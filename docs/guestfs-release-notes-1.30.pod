=head1 RELEASE NOTES FOR LIBGUESTFS 1.30

These release notes only cover the differences from the previous
stable/dev branch split (1.28.0).  For detailed changelogs, please see
the git repository, or the ChangeLog file distributed in the tarball.

=head2 New features

=head3 New tools

L<virt-dib(1)> is a secure and safe alternative to the OpenStack
"diskimage-builder" tool.  It is compatible with diskimage-builder
elements.  (Pino Toscano)

L<virt-get-kernel(1)> extracts the kernel and ramdisk from a disk
image.  Previously this functionality was part of L<virt-builder(1)>,
but the new tool is more featureful.  (Pino Toscano)

=head3 New features in existing tools

L<virt-v2v(1)> I<-i ova> mode can now read a wider range of OVA files,
and also unpacked files (directories).

virt-v2v now securely passes options to curl, so passwords, cookies
and so on cannot be seen by users with shell access on the same
machine.

virt-v2v has a new I<--password-file> option to allow you to securely
pass in a password, and to avoid an interactive prompt.

virt-v2v disables Windows autoreboot, making debugging conversion
failures on Windows easier.

virt-v2v now comes with an extensive external test suite.
See L<virt-v2v-test-harness(1)>.

virt-v2v allows virtio drivers to come from any location (Roman
Kagan), and drivers can be read directly from the virtio ISO.

virt-v2v supports conversion of Windows E<ge> 8.  Note this is
experimental, and possibly broken.  Use with caution.

virt-v2v can now convert UEFI guests.

L<virt-p2v(1)> adds a network configuration dialog.

virt-p2v now has C<p2v.pre>, C<p2v.post> and C<p2v.fail> triggers,
allowing arbitrary scripts for preparing the host for conversion and
tidying up post-conversion.

virt-p2v now uses the more advanced metacity window manager
(instead of matchbox).

L<virt-sysprep(1)> will remove C</var/spool/mail/username> for
non-root accounts (Hu Tao).

L<virt-customize(1)>, L<virt-builder(1)> and virt-sysprep have the
following new options:

=over 4

=item I<--commands-from-file>

allow long lists of commands to be read from a file instead of from
the command line (Pino Toscano)

=item I<--copy>

copy files inside the guest (Maros Zatko)

=item I<--copy-in>

copy host files recursively into the guest (Pino Toscano)

=item I<--move>

move files inside the guest (Maros Zatko)

=item I<--ssh-inject>

inject SSH keys into a guest (Pino Toscano)

=item I<--sm-attach>

=item I<--sm-credentials>

=item I<--sm-register>

=item I<--sm-remove>

=item I<--sm-unregister>

register and unregister a guest from subscription-manager
(Pino Toscano)

=item I<--touch>

touch a file in the guest (Pino Toscano)

=item I<--truncate>

=item I<--truncate-recursive>

truncate files (Maros Zatko)

=back

Improvements to virt-customize firstboot support.  In particular,
Windows firstboot should work as well as Linux (Roman Kagan).

L<virt-df(1)> can now use PolicyKit, SASL and other authentication
methods when getting the list of domains from libvirt.

Improvements to guestfish bash completion (Pino Toscano).

Bash completion now completes short options as well as long options
(Pino Toscano).

L<guestfish(1)> now displays a command synopsis if the number of
parameters given to a command is wrong (Hu Tao).

virt-builder now supports Red Hat Enterprise Linux versions back to RHEL 3.

virt-builder supports SUSE guests using zypper (CÃ©dric Bosdonnat).

=head3 Language bindings

The Java bindings now include validated Javadoc, and other improvements
(Pino Toscano).

Multiple fixes and improvements to the PHP bindings (Pino Toscano).

=head3 Inspection

Inspection can now get icons from RHEL 7 and CentOS 7.

F</etc/favicon.png> is now allowed to be a symbolic link.

For RPM-based guests, inspection now returns RPM Epoch fields.

Debian packages now have separate Epoch and Version fields
(Nikos Skalkotos).

OpenBSD detection added, FreeBSD and NetBSD added as separate
"distros", and other BSD inspection improvements and bug fixes
(Nikos Skalkotos).

CoreOS detection added (Nikos Skalkotos).

The package manager in Fedora E<ge> 22 is C<dnf>.

ReactOS guests can be inspected (Maros Zatko).

Add support for UEFI guests.

Inspection now works when kernel modules are gzip or xz compressed
(Pino Toscano).

Inspection now recognizes ppc64 and ppc64le guests (Maros Zatko).

Inspection lists the installed applications on Archlinux guests
(Nikos Skalkotos).

=head3 Architectures and platforms

PPC64 (POWER7) and PPC64LE (POWER8) architectures are now much better
supported, and should work out of the box.

For aarch64, we use AAVMF (an open source UEFI implementation based on
OVMF) if available to run the appliance.

For armv7, we now use the I<-M virt> machine type by default.

There is better support for compiling on non-Linux platforms
(Pino Toscano, Margaret Lewicka).

Libguestfs should now work on MIPS 32 bit little endian ("mipsel").  I
have not been able to try 64 bit or big endian.

=head2 Security

=over 4

=item CVE-2014-8484

=item CVE-2014-8485

Libguestfs previously ran the L<strings(1)> utility on untrusted
files.  Strings could parse BFD headers in an unsafe way, leading to
possible arbitrary code execution.  Libguestfs now runs strings with a
flag to ensure it does not try to parse BFD headers.  This could have
led to exploitation of the libguestfs appliance, but since libguestfs
further constrains the appliance through virtualization, SELinux and
other techniques, it was unlikely to have caused any privilege
escalation on the host.

=item XPath injection in virt-v2v

One possible XPath injection vulnerability was fixed in virt-v2v.
This might have allowed a malicious guest which was being converted by
virt-v2v to construct an arbitrary XPath expression which would have
been evaluated on the host (by the libxml2 library linked to the
virt-v2v binary).  It is not clear what the effects of this might be.

For further information, see upstream commit
L<https://github.com/libguestfs/libguestfs/commit/6c6ce85f94c36803fe2db35a98db436bff0c14b0>

=item Denial of service problems when using C<qemu-img info>

When using the American Fuzzy Lop fuzzer (C<afl-fuzz>) on the
C<qemu-img info> command, Richard W.M. Jones found that certain files
can cause the C<qemu-img> program to use lots of memory and time (for
example 6GB of heap and 14 seconds of CPU time on a fast Intel
processor), and in some cases to crash.  Since libguestfs may run
C<qemu-img info> on disk images to find out what they contain, this
transitively could cause libguestfs to hang or consume lots of memory.

Libguestfs was modified so that it uses resource limits to limit the
space and time used by C<qemu-img info>, to avoid this problem.  If a
malicious user tries to pass one of these disk images to libguestfs,
C<qemu-img> will crash and the crash is reported back to libguestfs
callers as an error message.




=back

=head2 API

=head3 New APIs

=over 4

L<https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1075164>

=item C<guestfs_copy_in>

=item C<guestfs_copy_out>

Flexible APIs for recursively copying directories of files between the
host and guest filesystem.  Previously these were available only as
guestfish commands, but now any API users can call them (Pino Toscano).

=item C<guestfs_part_set_gpt_guid>

Get and set the GPT per-partition GUID.

=item C<guestfs_part_get_mbr_part_type>

(Chen Hanxiao).

=back

=head3 Other API changes

C<guestfs_disk_create> can now use VMDK files as backing files.

C<guestfs_btrfs_subvolume_snapshot> takes extra optional
parameters (all added by Hu Tao):

=over 4

=item C<ro>

for creating a read-only Btrfs snapshot

=item C<qgroupid>

for adding the snapshot to a qgroup

=back

C<guestfs_btrfs_subvolume_create> can also take the optional
C<qgroupid> parameter (Hu Tao).

C<guestfs_set_uuid> can set UUID of swap partitions, Btrfs
(Hu Tao, Chen Hanxiao).

C<guestfs_copy_device_to_file> and C<guestfs_copy_file_to_file> have a
new optional C<append> parameter, allowing you to append to the output
file instead of truncating it.

C<guestfs_mkfs> has a new optional C<label> parameter to set the
initial label of the new filesystem (Pino Toscano).

C<guestfs_set_label> and C<guestfs_set_uuid> now set C<ENOTSUP> as errno
when there is no implemented support for the filesystem of the specified
mountable (Chen Hanxiao).

Environment variables now let you write C<LIBGUESTFS_DEBUG=true>,
C<LIBGUESTFS_DEBUG=0> and so on.

All C<guestfs_sfdisk*> APIs have been deprecated.  Because
L<sfdisk(8)> was rewritten, incompatibly, upstream, we don't recommend
using these APIs in future code.  Use the C<guestfs_part*> APIs as
replacements.

APIs such as C<guestfs_download> do not truncate F</dev/stdout> or
F</dev/stderr> when writing to them, meaning that if you redirect
stdout or stderr to a file, the file is no longer truncated.





=head2 Build changes

The daemon no longer uses its own separate copy of gnulib.  Instead it
shares a single copy with the library.

OCaml F<.annot> files are now created, so IDEs and editors like emacs
and vi can browse OCaml types in the source code.

Various fixes to allow different host/appliance architecture builds
(Pino Toscano).

Automake is now used directly to build all the OCaml programs, instead
of ad hoc Makefile rules.  One side effect of this is to enable
warnings in all the C code used by OCaml programs.

C<-fno-strict-overflow> is used throughout the build to avoid dubious
GCC optimizations.

Multiple cleanups to support GCC 5.

OCaml OUnit2 is needed to run some OCaml tests.

Creating a statically linked F<libguestfs.a> should work again.

The F<src/api-support> subdirectory and its scripts are no longer
used.  Instead we store in the F<generator/actions.ml> when the API
was added to libguestfs.

=head2 Internationalization

The translation service has changed from Transifex to Zanata.

Many more translations are available now, for both library and tools
messages and documentation.

=head2 Internals

In all OCaml tools, there are now common C<error>, C<warning>, C<info>
functions, and common way to set and get the I<--quiet>, I<-x> (trace)
and I<-v> (verbose) flags, and colour highlighting used consistently.

C<COMPILE_REGEXP> macros are used to simplify PCRE constructors and
destructors.

In the generator, C<Pointer> arguments have finally been implemented.

Internal identifiers no longer use double and triple underscores
(eg. C<guestfs___program_name>).  These identifiers are invalid for
C99 and C++ programs, although compilers would accept them.

The daemon no longer parses C<guestfs_*> options from
F</proc/cmdline>.  Instead it only takes ordinary command line
options.  The appliance init script turns F</proc/cmdline> into daemon
command line options.

The tests can now run the daemon as a "captive process", allowing it
to be run directly on the host.  The main advantage of this is we can
run valgrind directly on the daemon during testing.
