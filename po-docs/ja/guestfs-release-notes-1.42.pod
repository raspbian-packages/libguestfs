Those projects are now on a separate release cycle.  Release notes are
published separately.

=head2 New features

Add support for the Vala language (Corentin Noël).

Add support for the Rust language (Hiroyuki Katsura, sponsored by Google
Summer of Code).

Reproducible builds (Chris Lamb).

Advanced Format disks (which use 4K sectors) can now be processed by
libguestfs.  Use the new optional C<blocksize> parameter to
C<guestfs_add_drive_opts>, and the I<--blocksize> option added to several
tools (Nikolay Ivanets).

Windows CompactOS (NTFS file compression) is now supported.

=head3 New features in existing tools

Advanced machine readable output in various virt tools now supports JSON
output, and writing logs to a numbered file descriptor (Pino Toscano).

virt-filesystems tool now more accurately reports filesystem total size, in
the case where for example the filesystem does not occupy the whole of its
containing device (Pino Toscano).

=head3 Language bindings

Python E<ge> 2.7 is required.

Python bindings are now more extensively tested (Hiroyuki Katsura).

Python bindings should now work with Python E<ge> 3.8.

Multiple fixes to avoid crashes in the Python bindings (Sam Eiderman).

OCaml bindings are compiled with C<-DCAML_NAME_SPACE> to ensure no
non-caml_-namespaced symbols are used (Pino Toscano).

OCaml bindings should now work with OCaml 4.09 and 4.10.

Erlang has deprecated the old C<erl_interface> library which we use for
Erlang bindings.  It will be removed in OTP 22, which will permanently break
Erlang support unless someone steps forward to update the Erlang bindings in
libguestfs.

Fix compatibility with newer cgo for Go bindings (Tomáš Golembiovský).

Go API error handling is now more idiomatic (Csaba Henk).

Update documentation about how to handle boolean parameters in Ruby bindings
(Csaba Henk).

=head3 Inspection

Libguestfs can now extract icons for Gentoo, newer SUSE and OpenMandriva
guests.  Improved extraction of RHEL icons.  (Pino Toscano).

Inspection returns the osinfo IDs of newer Windows versions, and rolling
Linux distros (Pino Toscano).

OpenMandriva is now detected (Bernhard Rosenkränzer).

Arch Linux detection improvements (Pino Toscano).

=head3 Architectures and platforms

Libguestfs can now be compiled on OpenMandriva (Bernhard Rosenkränzer).

Ubuntu fix for enabling network support (Ioanna Alifieraki).

=head3 Other

Use of deprecated libguestfs APIs will now cause compiler deprecation
warnings by default, whereas previously you have to enable these warnings.
To turn off these warnings use C<-DGUESTFS_NO_WARN_DEPRECATED=1>.  A new
feature is that you can now disable deprecated APIs completely if you want,
using C<-DGUESTFS_NO_DEPRECATED=1> (Pino Toscano).

Fix hostname in virt-builder templates (Pino Toscano).

The single large release notes file is now split into multiple documents
organized by version.

The C<--key> option of several tools was broken, especially if you tried to
use the option to pass multiple keys.  This has been fixed and a regression
test added.

Augeas exceptions occurring in daemon (eg. during inspection) will now
produced detailed errors (Pino Toscano).

=head2 Security

No security issues were found in this release.

=head2 API

=head3 New APIs

C<luks_uuid> returns the UUID of a LUKS device (Pino Toscano).

=head3 Other API changes

Cope with new output from the C<btrfs scrub> command.  There is no visible
change at the API level.

New optional parameter C<blocksize> added to C<guestfs_add_drive_opts> to
support Advanced Format disks (Nikolay Ivanets).

=head2 Build changes

Minimum version of Augeas required is 1.2.0 (Pino Toscano).

C<common/> subdirectory is now a git submodule shared with the virt-v2v
project.

Supermin E<ge> 5.1.18 is required.

There were several bugs in libvirt 5.10.0 and 6.0 which affected
libguestfs.  It is highly advisable to use libvirt 6.1 where these bugs are
fixed (versions of libvirt E<lt> 5.10.0 are also fine).

Many gnulib modules which we were not using or which we used in only a few
places have been removed (Pino Toscano).

Multiple fixes for builddir != sourcedir builds (Pino Toscano).

A new C<bundled/> subdirectory contains one bundled library that we
currently use, C<ocaml-augeas> (Pino Toscano).

Fix compatibility issues when being compiled with GCC 10.

=head2 内部

When linking OCaml programs, automake silent rules and the C<V=1> flag are
both now obeyed (Pino Toscano).

The C<guestfs_device_index> API was reimplemented in library code instead of
in the daemon.  There should be no observable effect of this change.

Since Linux 5.6 enumerates C</dev/sdX> devices in parallel, libguestfs was
changed to map API device names to appliance device names, and then do the
reverse mapping when returning names from the appliance.  Hopefully this
should have no observable effect, but can produce somewhat confusing
debugging messages since device names in the debug might not match device
names passed in to APIs.  Furthermore the C<root=UUID=...> option is always
passed to the appliance (instead of naming the device containing the root
filesystem).

We expect to move from the Zanata service to the Weblate service for
translated strings.  For more information see
