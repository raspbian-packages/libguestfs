.SS "New features"
.IX Subsection "New features"
\fINew tools\fR
.IX Subsection "New tools"
.PP
Virt-tail is a new tool for following (tailing) log files within a guest, similar to the regular \f(CW\*(C`tail \-f\*(C'\fR command.
.PP
\fINew features in existing tools\fR
.IX Subsection "New features in existing tools"
.PP
Virt-customize, virt-get-kernel, virt-sparsify and virt-sysprep can now handle encrypted guests (Pino Toscano).
.PP
Virt-builder and virt-customize now support \fI\-\-append\-line\fR, which is useful for adding lines to the end of configuration files.
.PP
Virt-resize can now shrink and expand swap partitions (Pino Toscano).
.PP
Virt-resize can now output to non-local disks (Pino Toscano).
.PP
Virt-sysprep has a new operation called \f(CW\*(C`backup\-files\*(C'\fR for removing editor backups, and \f(CW\*(C`passwd\-backups\*(C'\fR for removing \fI/etc/passwd\-\fR and similar.
.PP
Virt-dib can now create checksums using the new \fI\-\-checksum\fR option (Pino Toscano).
.PP
Virt-dib can now create tgz files.  In addition, extended attributes and SELinux labels are preserved in the output tar file (Pino Toscano).
.PP
Virt-dib can now create squashfs files (Pino Toscano).
.PP
Bash tab-completion is now available in every command line tool that is shipped.
.PP
\fIvirt\-v2v and virt\-p2v\fR
.IX Subsection "virt-v2v and virt-p2v"
.PP
Conversions of Debian (6+) and Ubuntu (10.04+) guests are now supported (Tomáš Golembiovský, Pino Toscano).
.PP
Conversions from \s-1SUSE\s0 Xen hypervisor have now been tested (Cédric Bosdonnat).
.PP
Windows conversions may now install a program \f(CW\*(C`pnp_wait.exe\*(C'\fR which prevents conflicts between the Windows Plug-and-Play Manager and our own scripts that install virtio device drivers.  Enabling this requires the \f(CW\*(C`pnp_wait.exe\*(C'\fR program to be built separately (Roman Kagan).
.PP
\&\s-1OVA\s0 files exported from \s-1AWS\s0 can now be converted (Shahar Havivi).
.PP
When converting \s-1OVA\s0 files, in some circumstances virt\-v2v can now read disk images directly from the \s-1OVA\s0 input file instead of needing to unpack the \s-1OVA\s0 file to a temporary directory.  This can save large amounts of disk space, and is quicker (Tomáš Golembiovský).
.PP
Virt\-p2v can now be built on \s-1RHEL 5\s0 (2007\-era) Linux and \s-1RHEL 6,\s0 which means that 32 bit and hardware with ancient fakeraid disks can be virtualized. Binaries of virt\-p2v based on these old versions of \s-1RHEL\s0 can be found at http://oirase.annexia.org/virt\-p2v/
.PP
Virt\-p2v can now use nbdkit (an \s-1NBD\s0 server) as an alternative to qemu-nbd. In addition, virt\-p2v can use \*(L"socket activation\*(R" which is a more robust method for opening the \s-1NBD\s0 listening socket.  Socket activation works with qemu-nbd or nbdkit, but requires the most up to date versions.
.PP
To prevent timeouts during P2V conversions, virt\-p2v inhibits power saving on the physical machine, and also sends ping packets over the ssh control and data connections.
.PP
Virt\-v2v no longer removes the \f(CW\*(C`Processor\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`Intelppm\*(C'\fR nodes from the Windows Registry.
.PP
Xen and vCenter conversions can now be done using the libvirt backend, provided libvirt ≥ 2.1.0 is used.
.PP
\&\fI/dev/srX\fR (\s-1SCSI\s0 CD-ROM) devices are ignored (Tomáš Golembiovský).
.PP
When converting \s-1SUSE\s0 Linux guests, use \fI/etc/modprobe.conf.local\fR if it exists.
.PP
Removing VMware tools from Linux guests should now work reliably (Pino Toscano).
.PP
When converting \s-1OVA\s0 files, virt\-v2v now checks the disk image hash contained in the manifest file, whereas previously it was ignored because of a mistake in the code.  In addition, \s-1SHA256\s0 hashes are now supported (Tomáš Golembiovský).
.PP
When converting \s-1OVA\s0 files that contain compressed disk images, we now trust the \f(CW\*(C`ovf:compression\*(C'\fR attribute from the metadata instead of using content sniffing on the disk image (Tomáš Golembiovský).
.PP
A new flag \fI\-\-vdsm\-compat\fR has been added to \fI\-o vdsm\fR mode, allowing more efficient qcow2 images to be generated.
.PP
Since the \s-1RHEV\s0 product [commercially supported version of oVirt] has now been renamed to \s-1RHV, \*(L"RHEV\*(R"\s0 was changed to \*(L"\s-1RHV\*(R"\s0 throughout the tooling.  In particular, \fI\-o rhev\fR becomes \fI\-o rhv\fR, although the old name can be used for backwards compatibility.
.PP
The \f(CW\*(C`RHEV\-APT\*(C'\fR utility is only installed when the output hypervisor is oVirt or \s-1RHV.\s0
.PP
A problem with virt\-v2v running out of memory when doing an SELinux relabel of the guest filesystem should now be resolved.
.PP
\fILanguage bindings\fR
.IX Subsection "Language bindings"
.PP
Setting \f(CW\*(C`EXTRA_JAVAC_FLAGS\*(C'\fR before \fI./configure\fR allows you to add arbitrary flags to \f(CW\*(C`javac\*(C'\fR when compiling the Java bindings.
.PP
Use of any libguestfs \s-1API\s0 which returned a single struct, from Perl or Java bindings, would have leaked memory.  This has now been fixed (Pino Toscano).
.PP
\fIInspection\fR
.IX Subsection "Inspection"
.PP
Inspection of Windows guests with mildly corrupted Windows Registry hives should now work instead of failing with an error.  This feature requires hivex ≥ 1.3.14 (Dawid Zamirski).
.PP
For Debian guests, we can now read the \s-1URL,\s0 source name, summary and full description of installed packages.  For RPM-based guests we can read the \s-1URL,\s0 summary and description (Pino Toscano).
.PP
Inspection of guest operating systems that use a separate \fI/usr\fR partition should now work more reliably (Pino Toscano).
.PP
When parsing guest \fI/etc/fstab\fR, paths are reduced to a canonical form (eg. \f(CW"///usr//local//"\fR → \f(CW"/usr/local"\fR).
.PP
Inspection of btrfs subvolumes now works where the \fI/etc/fstab\fR options field contains commas.
.PP
\&\fI/dev/cdN\fR devices in guest \fI/etc/fstab\fR are ignored (Pino Toscano).
.PP
\fIArchitectures and platforms\fR
.IX Subsection "Architectures and platforms"
.PP
Stable releases are now tested on aarch64, ppc64 and ppc64le architectures.
.PP
The RISC-V architecture is now handled as a guest, and libguestfs will now at least compile on RISC-V (but probably not work as there is no usable qemu at the time of writing).
.PP
Detection of S/390 and S/390x binaries and guests is now supported.
.PP
\fIOther\fR
.IX Subsection "Other"
.PP
ExFAT filesystems are now supported (Miles Wolbe).
.SS "Security"
.IX Subsection "Security"
See also \fBguestfs\-security\fR\|(1).
.PP
There were no CVEs reported in this development cycle.  However some security-related hardening was carried out as described below.
.PP
Temporary filenames are now always generated using randomness from \fI/dev/urandom\fR (previously the C function \fBrandom\fR\|(3) was used in one case).
.PP
The \f(CW$TERM\fR environment variable is now validated before passing it through to the appliance kernel command line.

.Sp
This \s-1API\s0 can now return the following new values: \f(CW\*(C`riscv32\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`riscv64\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`riscv128\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`s390\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`s390x\*(C'\fR.

.SS "Build changes"
.IX Subsection "Build changes"
libmagic, the library part of the \f(CW\*(C`file\*(C'\fR command, is now required at build time (previously optional).
.PP
\&\s-1GCC 7\s0 is now supported.
.PP
\&\*(L"Silent rules\*(R" are now used for OCaml programs, Java bindings.  To show the full command line executed, add \f(CW\*(C`V=1\*(C'\fR on the make command line (Pino Toscano).
.PP
Slow testing (\f(CW\*(C`make check\-slow\*(C'\fR) now covers: firstboot scripts in Linux guests; v2v conversion of a selection of real Linux guests; the virt-customize \fI\-\-hostname\fR and \fI\-\-timezone\fR settings; the \fI\-\-root\-password\fR parameter; that the serial console works in virt-builder guests.
.PP
Large generated C source files, eg. the list of commands found in \fIfish/cmds.c\fR (and many more), have been split into smaller files to speed parallel compilation.
.PP
\&\f(CW\*(C`make maintainer\-check\-extra\-dist\*(C'\fR now checks that all generated files are included in the tarball.
.PP
The tests no longer assume that \f(CW\*(C`.\*(C'\fR is in Perl's \f(CW@INC\fR, as it is going to be removed soon (Pino Toscano).
.PP
Debian hosts using UsrMerge are now supported (Pino Toscano).
.PP
Header files and C structs can now have internal documentation using the special \f(CW\*(C`/** ... */\*(C'\fR comments.
.PP
\&\f(CW\*(C`@VAR@\*(C'\fR subtitutions in \f(CW\*(C`./run\*(C'\fR are now fully quoted.  This is necessary so that (eg) \f(CW\*(C`./configure PYTHON=/some/path\*(C'\fR works robustly if \f(CW\*(C`/some/path\*(C'\fR contains characters that need to be quoted (Hilko Bengen).
.PP
gperf ≥ 3.1 is now supported.
.PP
Kraxel's old edk2 builds can no longer be used for \s-1UEFI\s0 support.  \s-1UEFI\s0 code is now fully free software, so use the versions bundled with your Linux distro instead.
.PP
Virt\-p2v can now be compiled on \s-1RHEL 5\s0 (2007\-era) Linux with Gtk 2.10.
.SS "内部"
.IX Subsection "内部"
The generator and mllib \f(CW\*(C`Common_utils\*(C'\fR modules are now shared from the same source file.
.PP
A considerable amount of common code has been moved into the \fIcommon\fR directory in the source and is now compiled only once.  The mini-libraries located under here are: \fIcommon/edit\fR, \fIcommon/errnostring\fR, \fIcommon/miniexpect\fR, \fIcommon/options\fR, \fIcommon/parallel\fR, \fIcommon/progress\fR, \fIcommon/protocol\fR, \fIcommon/utils\fR, \fIcommon/visit\fR, \fIcommon/windows\fR.
.PP
The directory containing the main library code has moved from \fIsrc\fR → \fIlib\fR.
.PP
All tests written in shell script now use a common file of utility functions (\fItests/test\-functions.sh\fR).  There are several new utility functions, mainly for skipping tests.  Also these test scripts can now use autoconf-like path variables like \f(CW$abs_top_srcdir\fR.
.PP
\&\s-1UEFI\s0 paths are now stored in the generator (\fIgenerator/uefi.ml\fR).
.PP
The way the generator handles actions and procedure numbers was changed quite substantially.  See \fIgenerator/actions_*.ml\fR and \fIgenerator/proc_nr.ml\fR.
.PP
The gnulib \f(CW\*(C`getprogname\*(C'\fR module is now used everywhere when needing/printing the program name (Pino Toscano).
.PP
\&\fIperl/Guestfs.c\fR is not translatable (Nikos Skalkotos).
.PP
Virt-builder templates moved from \fIbuilder/website\fR to \fIbuilder/templates\fR and there is now a single unified program which can build any template.
.PP
All Windows registry utilities used by virt-customize and virt\-v2v have been moved to a common module called \f(CW\*(C`Registry\*(C'\fR under \fImllib\fR.
.PP
All \s-1POSIX\s0 bindings have been moved to a new module called \f(CW\*(C`Unix_utils\*(C'\fR under \fImllib\fR.
.PP
Inspection, virt-customize and virt\-v2v no longer recompute the Windows \f(CW\*(C`%systemroot%\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`CurrentControlSet\*(C'\fR or paths to the \f(CW\*(C`HKLM\eSYSTEM\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`HKLM\eSOFTWARE\*(C'\fR hives in multiple places.  Instead these are all computed once (during inspection) and passed to the other tools through various \f(CW\*(C`guestfs_inspect_get_windows_*\*(C'\fR APIs.
.PP
\&\f(CW\*(C`/dev/pts\*(C'\fR is now available inside the appliance, so any tools we run which require a pty will now work (Pino Toscano).
.PP
Most OCaml warnings have been fixed.
.PP
There is now a single common function for creating temporary files (\f(CW\*(C`guestfs_int_make_temp_path\*(C'\fR) (Matteo Cafasso).
.PP
The \f(CW$TERM\fR environment variable is now validated before passing it through to the appliance kernel command line.
.PP
Useless \s-1USB\s0 and memballoon devices are no longer created in the appliance (Laine Stump).
.PP
On aarch64 we now use virtio-pci for the appliance.  This is somewhat faster than virtio-mmio.
.PP
Use of \fBsrandom\fR\|(3) and \fBrandom\fR\|(3) has been minimized.  In particular, temporary filenames are no longer created based on randomness returned by \fBrandom\fR\|(3), but \fI/dev/urandom\fR is used instead.
