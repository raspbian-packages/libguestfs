=head1 RELEASE NOTES FOR LIBGUESTFS 1.22

These release notes only cover the differences from the previous stable/dev
branch split (1.20.0).  For detailed changelogs, please see the git
repository, or the ChangeLog file distributed in the tarball.

=head2 New features

=head3 API

The SYSLINUX and EXTLINUX bootloaders can now be installed in disk images
using the API.

Inspection can now handle filesystems such as btrfs where subvolumes are
separately mountable (Matthew Booth).

"Attach methods" are now known as "backends".  Compatibility with existing
code is preserved.

Filenames can contain ':', as long as newer QEMU is being used.

=head3 Tools

Virt-alignment-scan and virt-df scan multiple guests in parallel.

Guestmount now passes errno accurately back to userspace in almost all
cases.

Guestfish and other tools can now use a URI-like syntax to access remote
disks, eg:

 guestfish -a ssh://example.com/path/to/disk.img

Guestfish and guestmount now allow you to specify the filesystem type when
mounting, which is more secure (Dave Vasilevsky).

Guestfish is now the "guest filesystem shell".

Guestfish allows only C<1> C<true> C<t> C<yes> C<y> C<on> C<0> C<false> C<f>
C<no> C<n> C<off> for boolean values (case insensitive), and gives an error
for all other strings.

New tool C<guestunmount> for unmounting FUSE filesystems safely.

C<guestmount --no-fork> flag prevents guestmount from daemonizing.

Virt-resize now uses sparse copies by default, saving considerable space for
guests which are mostly empty.

Bash tab completion has been rewritten and can now handle most tools, and
correctly tab-complete C<--long> options.  In addition, bash completion
scripts are loaded on demand.

=head3 Language bindings

The Java API now supports events.

The Python object now inherits from the C<object> base class.

Python methods which previously returned lists of tuples can now be made to
return a Python dict.  For backwards compatibility, you have to enable this
by using the constructor option S<C<guestfs.GuestFS
(python_return_dict=True)>>.

The PHP bindings are now tested properly, and have had multiple fixes.

The long-deprecated Perl C<Sys::Guestfs::Lib> library has been removed.

=head3 例

新しいプログラム例は、デバッグを有効化し、ログメッセージを採取する方法を示します。

=head3 Other

Distributors can add arbitrary extra packages to the appliance by doing:

 ./configure --with-extra-packages="list of package names"

Distributors can use:

 ./configure --with-supermin-extra-options="..."

to add arbitrary extra options to supermin.

=head2 Security

No security issues were found in this release.

=head2 New APIs

 cp-r
 extlinux
 feature-available
 get-program
 is-whole-device
 part-get-gpt-type
 part-set-gpt-type
 rename
 set-program
 syslinux

C のみ:

 guestfs_event_to_string

=head2 内部

The febootstrap tool has now been renamed to "supermin".  Libguestfs can use
either, but now prefers "supermin".
L<http://people.redhat.com/~rjones/supermin/>

libxml2 が libguestfs をビルドするために必要です。

(hivex の) hivexregedit プログラムが git からビルドするために必要です。

Internal functions can no longer be used unless the caller defines
C<-DGUESTFS_PRIVATE=1>.

Enable C compiler warnings in Python, Ruby bindings.

Fail early and clearly if libvirt does not support qemu/KVM (eg. if default
libvirt connection is to Xen).

C<make print-subdirs> rule, useful for selectively running tests.

Multiple fixes to allow separated (sourcedir != builddir) builds.

Multiple fixes to Haskell bindings.

C<ln> and C<ln-f> APIs now capture C<errno> correctly.

Language binding tests use (mostly) a standard numbering scheme and aim to
test the same range of features in each language.  Also the number of
launches required has been reduced so these tests should run much more
quickly.

Library code internally uses GCC C<__attribute__((cleanup))> (if available)
to simplify memory allocation.

Internal header files have been reorganized.  See the comments in
F<src/guestfs-internal*.h>

Internal code shared between the library and certain tools is now located in
a static C<libutils> library.

Almost all subdirectories can now use parallel builds, although note that
the top-level directories still build in series.

Use of C<PATH_MAX> and C<NAME_MAX> has been eliminated from the code.

The Java API now requires JVM E<ge> 1.6.

Force use of C<serial-tests> with automake E<ge> 1.12.

Use of sockets in the library protocol layer is abstracted, allowing other
non-POSIX layers to be added in future (see F<src/conn-socket.c>).

C<qemu-img info --output json> is used if available, for more secure parsing
of the output of this command.

Distros can now use C<make INSTALLDIRS=vendor install> to place Ruby
bindings in vendordir.  This eliminates a non-upstream patch carried by both
Fedora and Debian.

Valgrind log files are now written to F<tmp/valgrind-I<DATE>-I<PID>.log>

C<make clean> cleans the local C<tmp/> directory.

The C API tests have been rewritten using a more flexible generator language
that allows arbitrary C code to be executing during tests.
