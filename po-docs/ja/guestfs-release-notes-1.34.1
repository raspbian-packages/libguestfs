These release notes only cover the differences from the previous stable/dev branch split (1.32.0).  For detailed changelogs, please see the git repository, or the ChangeLog file distributed in the tarball.
.SS "New features"
.IX Subsection "New features"
Multiple performance enhancements were made in libguestfs.  The \*(L"hot cache\*(R" time to launch to appliance should be under 1 second assuming recent qemu and kernel are installed.  There are also new utilities for precisely benchmarking libguestfs (\fIutils/boot\-benchmark\fR and \fIutils/boot\-analysis\fR in the source tree).
.PP
The virt\-p2v tool for converting physical machines to virtual machines was substantially improved.  This includes: clearer, coloured output during conversions, support for Gtk 3, more detailed information about hardware, click to identify network interfaces, more debugging tools included with the \s-1ISO,\s0 and many bug fixes.
.PP
f2fs (Flash Friendly File System) is now supported (Pino Toscano).
.PP
\fINew tools\fR
.IX Subsection "New tools"
.PP
\&\fBvirt\-p2v\-make\-kiwi\fR\|(1) can be used to build the virt\-p2v \s-1ISO\s0 based on \s-1SLES\s0 and openSUSE, using the kiwi utility (Cédric Bosdonnat).
.PP
\fINew features in existing tools\fR
.IX Subsection "New features in existing tools"
.PP
virt-resize will now preserve the \s-1GPT GUID.\s0  This was required for Windows Server 2012 R2, where the bootloader would become confused if the \s-1GUID\s0 changed (Maxim Perevedentsev).
.PP
virt-resize will use sparse copying for (old MBR-style) extended partitions.  This makes resizing of guests that use extended partitions much faster (Maxim Perevedentsev).
.PP
virt\-p2v kernel command line options can now be used to set defaults for \s-1GUI\s0 configuration.
.PP
The virt\-p2v debugging options have been completely removed, simplifying the interface and documentation.  Debugging information is now captured fully automatically.
.PP
virt\-p2v\-make\-disk lets you specify an \fI\-\-arch\fR option, allowing you to build a 32 bit virt\-p2v, for compatibility with older systems.
.PP
virt\-p2v\-make\-disk no longer requires that you specify an \f(CW\*(C`os\-version\*(C'\fR for the virt\-p2v disk.  If omitted it will try to choose a suitable \f(CW\*(C`os\-version\*(C'\fR depending on your host system.
.PP
virt\-p2v\-make\-disk and virt\-p2v\-make\-kickstart both gain a new \fI\-\-install\fR option that allows you to add arbitrary extra packages to the virt\-p2v \s-1ISO,\s0 for customization, additional debugging tools and so on.
.PP
virt\-v2v will now uninstall Parallels Tools (or the equivalent Virtuozzo Tools) from Linux guests.  Also stop the Windows drivers from loading at boot.  (Roman Kagan and Pavel Butsykin)
.PP
virt\-v2v \fI\-\-in\-place\fR mode has been enhanced to allow the caller to choose whether or not to install certain virtio drivers in the guest (Roman Kagan).
.PP
virt\-v2v conversion of Windows guests was substantially rewritten and simplified (Roman Kagan).
.PP
virt\-v2v \fI\-\-in\-place\fR mode now supports installing virtio-scsi drivers in guests (Roman Kagan).
.PP
virt\-v2v can now convert \s-1SUSE\s0 guests and \s-1SUSE\s0 guests using \s-1UEFI\s0 (Cédric Bosdonnat and Jim Fehlig).
.PP
virt\-v2v can now convert guests to Glance that have multiple disks. Previously it would fail on such guests.
.PP
The virt\-v2v \fI\-\-no\-trim\fR and \fI\-\-vmtype\fR options are now no-ops.  They will print a warning but are otherwise ignored.  virt\-v2v can now generate the \s-1OVF\s0 vmtype correctly without user intervention.
.PP
virt\-v2v has now been tested against \s-1SUSE\s0 Xen as a source hypervisor (Cédric Bosdonnat).
.PP
virt\-v2v adds support for \s-1SUSE VMDP\s0 drivers (Cédric Bosdonnat).
.PP
virt\-v2v can convert \s-1OVA\s0 files containing subfolders, as produced by \s-1SUSE\s0 Studio (Cédric Bosdonnat).
.PP
virt\-v2v sets the \s-1OVF\s0 \f(CW\*(C`<Origin>\*(C'\fR element correctly.  oVirt has been extended to support more source hypervisors (Shahar Havivi).
.PP
virt\-v2v now supports Windows Server 2016 (Tomáš Golembiovský).
.PP
The virt-builder \fI\-\-list\fR option can now be used to show all templates or a single template (Pino Toscano).
.PP
All OCaml-based tools now use \fBgetopt_long\fR\|(3) for option parsing, and \fI\-\-help\fR output has been improved (Pino Toscano).
.PP
virt-builder and virt-customize \fI\-\-selinux\-relabel\fR option can now fully relabel the guest filesystem at build time, without requiring a lengthy autorelabel at first boot.
.PP
virt-customize \fI\-\-delete\fR now accepts globs.
.PP
New virt-customize \fI\-\-uninstall\fR option lets you uninstall packages.
.PP
virt-customize can now use \f(CW\*(C`pvvxsvc\*(C'\fR as an alternative to \f(CW\*(C`rhsrvany\*(C'\fR for running firstboot scripts in Windows guests (Cédric Bosdonnat).
.PP
virt-customize now uses the strongest hashing scheme for passwords on Arch and Void Linux (Pino Toscano).
.PP
virt-customize \fI\-\-install\fR now works correctly on Arch (Pino Toscano).
.PP
virt-inspector has new options \fI\-\-no\-applications\fR and \fI\-\-no\-icon\fR to prevent the list of applications and icon from being included in the \s-1XML\s0 output (Pino Toscano).
.PP
New virt-sysprep \fI\-\-network\fR option has been added, allowing you to actually use the \fI\-\-install\fR etc options which were present in virt-sysprep before but did not usually work.  Note that the network is still disabled by default.
.PP
virt-sysprep \f(CW\*(C`fs\-uuids\*(C'\fR operation no longer fails on btrfs guests (Maxim Perevedentsev).
.PP
virt-dib can output Docker images (Pino Toscano).
.PP
virt-dib has a new \fI\-\-drive\-format\fR option to allow the user to specify the format of the helper drive (Pino Toscano).
.PP
All OCaml virt tools now have a \fI\-\-colors\fR/\fI\-\-colours\fR option which enables coloured output (using \s-1ANSI\s0 escape sequences) even if the output is not a tty.  The default is to check if the output is a tty and disable coloured output if not.  This allows coloured output to be consumed by other tools.
.PP
\fILanguage bindings\fR
.IX Subsection "Language bindings"
.PP
\&\s-1PHP\s0 test coverage has been enhanced (Pino Toscano).
.PP
\&\s-1PHP 7\s0 is now supported (Pino Toscano).
.PP
Python bindings are now compliant with \s-1PEP 8\s0 (Pino Toscano).
.PP
A Python pip package is available in http://libguestfs.org/download/python/
.PP
The Ruby bindings now print the full exception if one is thrown by the event callback.  Note this is still incorrect behaviour as event callbacks should not throw exceptions, but it aids debugging.
.PP
All OCaml libraries and programs are now compiled with \fI\-safe\-string\fR, if supported by the OCaml compiler.
.PP
\fIInspection\fR
.IX Subsection "Inspection"
.PP
Alpine Linux using busybox can now be inspected.  Also the \s-1APK\s0 package manager is supported in virt-customize (Pino Toscano).
.PP
We now handle inspection of Mageia 4 (Pino Toscano).
.PP
Void Linux and the Void Linux xbps package manager are fully supported (Pino Toscano).
.PP
Parsing of CoreOS version information has been enhanced (Pino Toscano).
.PP
It is now possible to get an icon from \s-1ALT\s0 Linux (Pino Toscano).
.PP
\&\s-1PLD\s0 Linux versions < 3 are now recognized (Pino Toscano).
.PP
Windows drive letters are now returned for guests using \s-1GPT\s0 partitions (Dawid Zamirski).
.PP
We can now correctly inspect Unix guests that do not have an \fI/etc/fstab\fR file (Pino Toscano).
.PP
Added another source for the Ubuntu icon which doesn't rely on \s-1GNOME\s0 having been installed in the guest.
.PP
We can now get an icon for Windows 7 64 bit guests.
.PP
Libosinfo integration was rewritten to deal with the new database format used by osinfo (Pino Toscano).
.PP
\fIDocumentation\fR
.IX Subsection "Documentation"
.PP
New manual page \fBguestfs\-building\fR\|(1) describes how to build libguestfs from source.
.PP
The man pages, tools and tool \fI\-\-help\fR output is now automatically checked to ensure that all tool options are properly documented, that warning sections are included where necessary, and that every page has a description section.
.PP
The \fBguestfs\-testing\fR\|(1) man page has been refreshed and based on a newer libguestfs.
.PP
\fIArchitectures and platforms\fR
.IX Subsection "Architectures and platforms"
.PP
virt-customize now works on \s-1POWER7\s0 and \s-1POWER8\s0 platforms, both big endian and little endian (Xianghua Chen and Hu Zhang).
.SS "Security"
.IX Subsection "Security"
See also \fBguestfs\-security\fR\|(1).
.PP
\fI\s-1CVE\-2015\-8869\s0\fR
.IX Subsection "CVE-2015-8869"
.PP
https://bugzilla.redhat.com/CVE\-2015\-8869
.PP
This vulnerability in OCaml might affect virt tools written in the OCaml programming language.  It affects only 64 bit platforms.  Because this bug affects code generation it is difficult to predict which precise software could be affected, and therefore our recommendation is that you recompile libguestfs using a version of the OCaml compiler where this bug has been fixed (or ask your Linux distro to do the same).
.PP
\fIvirt-customize ownership of \fI.ssh\fI, \fI.ssh/authorized_keys\fI\fR
.IX Subsection "virt-customize ownership of .ssh, .ssh/authorized_keys"
.PP
https://bugzilla.redhat.com/1337561
.PP
Previously when virt-customize injected an \s-1SSH\s0 key into a guest, when it created the \fI~/.ssh\fR and \fI~/.ssh/authorized_keys\fR directory and file (in case they were missing) it created them with owner and group \f(CW\*(C`root.root\*(C'\fR. This has been fixed so the correct user is used.  This is not thought to have been exploitable.
.PP
\fIWindows \f(CI\*(C`%systemroot%\*(C'\fI\fR
.IX Subsection "Windows %systemroot%"
.PP
The inspection code has been made more robust against guests which might use very long \f(CW\*(C`%systemroot%\*(C'\fR (derived from the guest-controlled Windows Registry).  This is not thought to have been exploitable.
.PP
\fIVirtio-rng is now available in the appliance\fR
.IX Subsection "Virtio-rng is now available in the appliance"
.PP
virtio-rng (the virtual Random Number Generator device) is now passed to the appliance, which should improve the quality random numbers generated for GUIDs and cryptographic key generation.

Use the new \s-1API\s0 \f(CW\*(C`guestfs_selinux_relabel\*(C'\fR to relabel filesystems.  Use \f(CW\*(C`guestfs_lgetxattrs\*(C'\fR to list the \f(CW\*(C`security.selinux\*(C'\fR extended attributes of existing files.
.PP
\&\f(CW\*(C`guestfs_vfs_minimum_size\*(C'\fR can now be used on dirty filesystems (Maxim Perevedentsev).
.PP
\&\f(CW\*(C`guestfs_ll\*(C'\fR now works on paths which contain absolute symlinks (Pino Toscano).
.PP
\&\f(CW\*(C`guestfs_glob_expand\*(C'\fR now has an optional \f(CW\*(C`directoryslash\*(C'\fR boolean parameter which controls whether trailing slashes are returned for directory names (Pino Toscano).
.PP
\&\f(CW\*(C`guestfs_lvs\*(C'\fR will no longer return LVs which have the \f(CW\*(C`activationskip\*(C'\fR flag set.  The reason is that such LVs have no \f(CW\*(C`/dev/VG/LV\*(C'\fR device node and so code which read the list of LVs and then probed the devices themselves would immediately fail.  You can use \f(CW\*(C`guestfs_lvs_full\*(C'\fR if you want to read all LVs.  (Pino Toscano).
.PP
\&\f(CW\*(C`guestfs_list_disk_labels\*(C'\fR now no longer fails if no disks with labels were added.  Instead it now returns an empty list (Pino Toscano).

.PP
\&\f(CW\*(C`make check\-valgrind\*(C'\fR now has substantially better coverage.
.PP
\&\f(CW\*(C`make check\-slow\*(C'\fR now works again.
.PP
Use \f(CW\*(C`make \-C appliance clean\-supermin\-appliance\*(C'\fR to clean the supermin appliance (it will be rebuilt on next \f(CW\*(C`make\*(C'\fR).
.PP
There are a variety of new rules for running virt\-p2v from the source directory: \f(CW\*(C`make \-C p2v run\-virt\-p2v\-directly\*(C'\fR | \f(CW\*(C`run\-virt\-p2v\-in\-a\-vm\*(C'\fR | \f(CW\*(C`run\-virt\-p2v\-non\-gui\-conversion\*(C'\fR.  These are documented further in \fBguestfs\-hacking\fR\|(1).
.PP
virt\-p2v may be built using either Gtk 2 or Gtk 3.  To force a particular version of Gtk to be used, \f(CW\*(C`./configure \-\-with\-gtk=2|3\*(C'\fR
.PP
The \f(CW\*(C`./configure\*(C'\fR options are now mostly documented in \fBguestfs\-building\fR\|(1).
.SS "内部"
.IX Subsection "内部"
In git, versions are now tagged with \f(CW\*(C`v1.XX.YY\*(C'\fR (previously they were tagged with \f(CW\*(C`1.XX.YY\*(C'\fR).  Using the \f(CW\*(C`v\-\*(C'\fR prefix is more common in git repositories.
.PP
When using the libvirt backend, we now wait for qemu to exit gracefully instead of killing it after 15 seconds.  This helps when writing to slow devices (especially cheap \s-1USB\s0 keys).
.PP
Error messages from libvirt now include the \f(CW\*(C`err\->int1\*(C'\fR field which usually contains the \f(CW\*(C`errno\*(C'\fR.
.PP
On \s-1ARM,\s0 all \s-1DTB\s0 (device tree) code has been removed.  qemu creates the right device tree on the fly, we do not need to specify one.
.PP
The C \s-1API\s0 tests now use larger test disks, allowing \s-1BTRFS\s0 to be tested properly (Pino Toscano).
.PP
The tests should now work on a pure Python 3 host (Pino Toscano).
.PP
In C bindings, internal functions are now (mostly) consistently named \f(CW\*(C`guestfs_int_*\*(C'\fR whereas previously there was no consistent scheme.
.PP
The old \f(CW\*(C`safe_malloc\*(C'\fR etc functions are now no longer exported by the library, nor used in language bindings.
.PP
Setting \s-1TMPDIR\s0 to a path longer than ~ 100 characters will no longer cause libguestfs to fail silently and randomly when creating Unix domain sockets (Pino Toscano).
.PP
The \f(CW\*(C`COMPILE_REGEXP\*(C'\fR macro can now be used in the daemon.
.PP
When tracing, results containing structs are now printed in full (Pino Toscano).
.PP
The Perl \f(CW\*(C`Sys::Guestfs\*(C'\fR module now no longer embeds an incrementing \s-1API\s0 \*(L"version number\*(R".  This module is now always at phony version \*(L"1.0\*(R".  To find the real version of libguestfs from Perl you must call \f(CW\*(C`$g\->version\*(C'\fR.
.PP
All code is compiled with \f(CW\*(C`\-Wstack\-usage=10000\*(C'\fR and multiple changes have been made to remove stack allocation of large strings and buffers.
.PP
The \fBerror\fR\|(3) function is now used everywhere, replacing most previous uses of \fBperror\fR\|(3) + \fBexit\fR\|(3), and \fBfprintf\fR\|(3) + exit.
.PP
In C code, \f(CW\*(C`/**\*(C'\fR comments are turned into documentation which is automatically added to the \fBguestfs\-hacking\fR\|(1) manual page.
.PP
A safe \*(L"getumask\*(R" function has been added.  For recent Linux kernels this uses the newly added \f(CW\*(C`Umask\*(C'\fR field in \fI/proc/self/status\fR.  For older Linux and other Unix, this uses a thread-safe technique involving \fBfork\fR\|(2) (thanks: Josh Stone, Jiri Jaburek, Eric Blake).
.PP
Safe \fBposix_fadvise\fR\|(2) wrappers have been added, and more hints have been added to the code which may make a minor difference to performance.
.PP
A safe wrapper around \fBwaitpid\fR\|(2) has been added which handles \f(CW\*(C`INTR\*(C'\fR properly.
.PP
\&\f(CW\*(C`podwrapper.pl\*(C'\fR (used to generate the manual pages) now stops if any \s-1POD\s0 error is found.  A new script called \f(CW\*(C`podcheck.pl\*(C'\fR does cross-checking of \fI\-\-help\fR output, tool options and manual pages.
.PP
All version numbers in the library (eg. versions of qemu, versions of libvirt, versions of guest operating systems) are unified in a single file \fIsrc/version.c\fR (Pino Toscano).
.PP
On Windows guests, virt-customize will use the vendor-neutral path \f(CW\*(C`C:\eProgram Files\eGuestfs\eFirstboot\*(C'\fR to store firstboot scripts. Previously it used \f(CW\*(C`C:\eProgram Files\eRed Hat\eFirstboot\*(C'\fR.  This change should be invisible to the scripts themselves.  (Cédric Bosdonnat)
.PP
On Linux guests, the firstboot services generated by virt-builder \fI\-\-firstboot\fR etc have been renamed to \f(CW\*(C`guestfs\-firstboot\*(C'\fR (Pino Toscano).
.PP
There is now a common \f(CW\*(C`debug\*(C'\fR function used by all OCaml tools, replacing previous code which did \f(CW\*(C`if verbose () then printf ...\*(C'\fR.
.PP
virt\-p2v copies files it needs over to the virt\-v2v conversion server using \fBscp\fR\|(1), instead of trying to send them via the shell session.  This should improve reliability and should be a completely transparent to end users.
.PP
All code in \fImllib\fR is now built into a single \f(CW\*(C`mllib.cma\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`mllib.cmxa\*(C'\fR library.  All code in \fIcustomize\fR is now built into a single \f(CW\*(C`customize.cma\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`customize.cmxa\*(C'\fR library.  This simplifies the build of the OCaml tools.
.PP
\&\fBlvmetad\fR\|(8) is now used in the appliance when available (Pino Toscano).
