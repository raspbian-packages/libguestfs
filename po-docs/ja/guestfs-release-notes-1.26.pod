=head1 RELEASE NOTES FOR LIBGUESTFS 1.26

These release notes only cover the differences from the previous stable/dev
branch split (1.24.0).  For detailed changelogs, please see the git
repository, or the ChangeLog file distributed in the tarball.

=head2 New features

=head3 Tools

L<virt-customize(1)> is a new tool for customizing virtual machine disk
images.  It lets you install packages, edit configuration files, run
scripts, set passwords and so on.  L<virt-builder(1)> and L<virt-sysprep(1)>
use virt-customize, and command line options across all these tools are now
identical.

L<virt-diff(1)> is a new tool for showing the differences between the
filesystems of two virtual machines.  It is mainly useful when showing what
files have been changed between snapshots.

L<virt-builder(1)> has been greatly enhanced.  There are many more ways to
customize the virtual machine.  It can pull templates from multiple
repositories.  A parallelized internal xzcat implementation speeds up
template decompression.  Virt-builder uses an optimizing planner to choose
the fastest way to build the VM.  It is now easier to use virt-builder from
other programs.  Internationalization support has been added to metadata.
More efficient SELinux relabelling of files.  Can build guests for multiple
architectures.  Error messages have been improved.  (Pino Toscano)

L<virt-sparsify(1)> has a new I<--in-place> option.  This sparsifies an
image in place (without copying it) and is also much faster.  (Lots of help
provided by Paolo Bonzini)

L<virt-sysprep(1)> can delete and scrub files under user control.  You can
lock user accounts or set random passwords on accounts.  Can remove more log
files.  Can unsubscribe a guest from Red Hat Subscription Manager.  New
flexible way to enable and disable operations.  (Wanlong Gao, Pino Toscano)

L<virt-win-reg(1)> allows you to use URIs to specify remote disk images.

L<virt-format(1)> can now pass the extra space that it recovers back to the
host.

L<guestfish(1)> has additional environment variables to give fine control
over the C<E<gt>E<lt>fsE<gt>> prompt.  Guestfish reads its (rarely used)
configuration file in a different order now so that local settings override
global settings.  (Pino Toscano)

L<virt-make-fs(1)> was rewritten in C, but is unchanged in terms of
functionality and command line usage.

=head3 Language bindings

The OCaml bindings have a new C<Guestfs.Errno> module, used to check the
error number returned by C<Guestfs.last_errno>.

PHP tests now work.  (Pino Toscano)

=head3 Inspection

Inspection can recognize Debian live images.

=head3 Architectures

ARMv7 (32 bit) now supports KVM acceleration.

Aarch64 (ARM 64 bit) is supported, but the appliance part does not work yet.

PPC64 support has been fixed and enhanced.

=head2 Security

=over 4

=item Denial of service when inspecting disk images with corrupt btrfs volumes

It was possible to crash libguestfs (and programs that use libguestfs as a
library) by presenting a disk image containing a corrupt btrfs volume.

This was caused by a NULL pointer dereference causing a denial of service,
and is not thought to be exploitable any further.

See commit d70ceb4cbea165c960710576efac5a5716055486 for the fix.  This fix
is included in libguestfs stable branches S<E<ge> 1.26.0>, S<E<ge> 1.24.6>
and S<E<ge> 1.22.8>, and also in RHEL S<E<ge> 7.0>.  Earlier versions of
libguestfs are not vulnerable.

=item Better generation of random root passwords and random seeds

When generating random root passwords and random seeds, two bugs were fixed
which are possibly security related.  Firstly we no longer read excessive
bytes from F</dev/urandom> (most of which were just thrown away).  Secondly
we changed the code to avoid modulo bias.  These issues were not thought to
be exploitable.  (Both changes suggested by Edwin Török)

=back

=head2 API

GUID parameters are now validated when they are passed to API calls, whereas
previously you could have passed any string.  (Pino Toscano)

=head3 New APIs

=over 4

=item C<guestfs_add_drive_opts>: new C<discard> parameter

The new C<discard> parameter allows fine-grained control over discard/trim
support for a particular disk.  This allows the host file to become more
sparse (or thin-provisioned) when you delete files or issue the
C<guestfs_fstrim> API call.

=item C<guestfs_add_domain>: new parameters: C<cachemode>, C<discard>

These parameters are passed through when adding the domain's disks.

=item C<guestfs_blkdiscard>

Discard all blocks on a guestfs device.  Combined with the C<discard>
parameter above, this makes the host file sparse.

=item C<guestfs_blkdiscardzeroes>

Test if discarded blocks read back as zeroes.

=item C<guestfs_compare_*>

=item C<guestfs_copy_*>

For each struct returned through the API, libguestfs now generates
C<guestfs_compare_*> and C<guestfs_copy_*> functions to allow you to compare
and copy structs.

=item C<guestfs_copy_attributes>

Copy attributes (like permissions, xattrs, ownership) from one file to
another.  (Pino Toscano)

=item C<guestfs_disk_create>

A flexible API for creating empty disk images from scratch.  This avoids the
need to call out to external programs like L<qemu-img(1)>.

=item C<guestfs_get_backend_settings>

=item C<guestfs_set_backend_settings>

Per-backend settings (can also be set via the environment variable
C<LIBGUESTFS_BACKEND_SETTINGS>).  The main use for this is forcing TCG mode
in the qemu-based backends, for example:

 export LIBGUESTFS_BACKEND=direct
 export LIBGUESTFS_BACKEND_SETTINGS=force_tcg

=item C<guestfs_part_get_name>

Get the label or name of a partition (for GPT disk images).

=back

=head2 Build changes

The following extra packages are required to build libguestfs 1.26:

=over 4

=item supermin E<ge> 5

Supermin version 5 is required to build this version of libguestfs.

=item flex, bison

Virt-builder now uses a real parser to parse its metadata file, so these
tools are required.

=item xz

This is now a required build dependency, where previously it was (in theory)
optional.

=back

=head2 内部

PO message extraction rewritten to be more robust.  (Pino Toscano)

C<podwrapper> gives an error if the I<--insert> or I<--verbatim> argument
pattern is not found.

Libguestfs now passes the qemu I<-enable-fips> option to enable FIPS, if
qemu supports it.

C<./configure --without-qemu> can be used if you don't want to specify a
default hypervisor.

Copy-on-write [COW] overlays, used for example for read-only drives, are now
created through an internal backend API (C<.create_cow_overlay>).

Libvirt backend uses some funky C macros to generate XML.  These are simpler
and safer.

The ChangeLog file format has changed.  It is now just the same as C<git
log>, instead of using a custom format.

Appliance start-up has changed:

=over 4

=item *

The libguestfs appliance now initializes LVM the same way as it is done on
physical machines.

=item *

The libguestfs appliance does not write an empty string to
F</proc/sys/kernel/hotplug> when starting up.

Note that you B<must> configure your kernel to have
C<CONFIG_UEVENT_HELPER_PATH=""> otherwise you will get strange LVM errors
(this applies as much to any Linux machine, not just libguestfs).  (Peter
Rajnoha)

=back

Libguestfs can now be built on arches that have L<ocamlc(1)> but not
L<ocamlopt(1)>.  (Hilko Bengen, Olaf Hering)

You cannot use C<./configure --disable-daemon --enable-appliance>.  It made
no sense anyway.  Now it is expressly forbidden by the configure script.

The packagelist file uses C<m4> for macro expansion instead of C<cpp>.
