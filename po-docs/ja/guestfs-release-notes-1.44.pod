=head1 RELEASE NOTES FOR LIBGUESTFS 1.44

=head2 Language bindings

Python 2 support has been dropped.  The minimum version of Python required
is 3.6.

Python bindings no longer use deprecated C<PyEval_ThreadsInitialized>.

Python bindings now include type hints (Sam Eiderman).

Erlang bindings now use libei instead of liberl_interface (Sergei Golovan).

=head2 Tools

L<virt-get-kernel(1)> can now find uncompressed kernels (Pino Toscano).

L<virt-sysprep(1)> now regenerates the guest certificate store when a
certificate is removed from the guest (Pino Toscano).

L<virt-sysprep(1)> can now remove IPA enrollment files and Kerberos keytabs
(Pino Toscano, Christian Heimes and François Cami).

=head2 API

=head3 New APIs

C<cryptsetup-open> and C<cryptsetup-close> replace C<luks-open>,
L<luks-open-ro> and L<luks-close>.  The new APIs add support for BitLocker
encryption.

=head3 Other API changes

C<lvm-canonical-lv> no longer produces a noisy error message when called
with a non-LV parameter.

=head2 Build changes

C programs using libguestfs can now be compiled against the build directory:

 ../libguestfs/run ./configure
 ../libguestfs/run make

OCaml components are now linked correctly when building in a different
directory from the source (Geoff Toole).

GCC LTO is now supported.

Weblate is now used for localization instead of Zanata (Pino Toscano).

The dependencies for guestfsd are no longer hard-coded but are now generated
from the built binary, ensuring that they shouldn't get out of synch in
future (Hilko Bengen).

=head2 内部

F<lib/guestfs.h> was moved to F<include/guestfs.h> in the source.  This is
not an externally visible change but affected a lot of places inside the
build system.
