.SS "New features"
.IX Subsection "New features"
\fINew tools\fR
.IX Subsection "New tools"
.PP
Virt-builder-repository is a new tool allowing end users to create and update virt-builder repositories (Cédric Bosdonnat).
.PP
Virt-rescue (while not a new tool) has been substantially rewritten, implementing job control, \fI\-m\fR and \fI\-i\fR options, escape keys, etc.
.PP
\fINew features in existing tools\fR
.IX Subsection "New features in existing tools"
.PP
Virt-builder planner has been improved so that faster and more efficient build plans are chosen for complex cases, especially when either the tmpdir or output is on networked storage.
.PP
New virt-builder Fedora templates (starting with Fedora 26) will have plain partition layout and use \s-1GPT\s0 for partitions.
.PP
Virt-customize \*(L"firstboot\*(R" scripts in guests using systemd are now installed under the \f(CW\*(C`multi\-user.target\*(C'\fR instead of \f(CW\*(C`default.target\*(C'\fR so they will only run when the system is booted normally.
.PP
Virt-customize now sets a random \fI/etc/machine\-id\fR for Linux guests, if one is not already set.
.PP
Virt-df now works correctly on filesystems with block sizes smaller than 1K (Nikolay Ivanets).
.PP
Virt-dib has further compatibility enhancements with diskimage-builder (Pino Toscano).
.PP
Virt-sysprep removes \f(CW\*(C`DHCP_HOSTNAME\*(C'\fR from \fIifcfg\-*\fR files.
.PP
Virt-sysprep now works on Oracle Linux (Jamie Iles).
.PP
Virt-resize now correctly copies \s-1GPT\s0 partition attributes from the source to the destination (Cédric Bosdonnat).
.PP
Bash tab completion implemented or enhanced for: virt-win-reg, virt\-v2v\-copy\-to\-local.
.PP
\fIvirt\-v2v and virt\-p2v\fR
.IX Subsection "virt-v2v and virt-p2v"
.PP
Virt\-v2v can now read VMware \s-1VMX\s0 files directly, either from local disk, \s-1NFS\s0 storage, or over \s-1SSH\s0 from an ESXi hypervisor.
.PP
Virt\-v2v can now use \s-1VDDK\s0 as an input source.
.PP
Both virt\-v2v and virt\-p2v are now able to pass through the source \s-1CPU\s0 vendor, model and topology.  However unfortunately not all source and target hypervisors are able to provide or consume this data at present (Tomáš Golembiovský).
.PP
Virt\-v2v now supports encrypted guests (Pino Toscano).
.PP
Virt\-v2v can now handle VMware snapshots.  Note that the snapshots are collapsed — it \fIdoes not\fR convert the chain of snapshots into a chain of snapshots.
.PP
Virt\-v2v now installs Windows 10 / Windows Server 2016 virtio block drivers correctly (Pavel Butsykin, Kun Wei).
.PP
Virt\-v2v now installs virtio-rng, balloon and pvpanic drivers, and correctly sets this in the target hypervisor metadata for hypervisors which support that (Tomáš Golembiovský).
.PP
Virt\-v2v now installs both legacy and modern virtio keys in the Windows registry (Ladi Prosek).
.PP
Virt\-p2v can now preserve (in some cases) the offset of the Real Time Clock from \s-1UTC.\s0
.PP
Virt\-p2v now combines several scp commands to the conversion server into a single command, improving conversion times.
.PP
Virt\-v2v now detects the special Linux Xen PV-only kernels correctly (Laszlo Ersek).
.PP
Virt\-v2v \fI\-o glance\fR now generates the right properties for \s-1UEFI\s0 guests (Pino Toscano).
.PP
Virt\-v2v \fI\-o null\fR now avoids spooling the guest to a temporary file, instead it writes to the qemu \*(L"null block device\*(R".  This makes it faster and use almost no disk space.
.PP
Virt\-v2v \fI\-o rhv\fR now supports Windows 2016 Server guest type.
.PP
Virt\-v2v \fI\-i libvirtxml\fR can now open network disks over http or https.
.PP
Virt\-v2v will now give a warning about host passthrough devices (Pino Toscano).
.PP
The virt\-v2v \fI\-\-machine\-readable\fR output has been enhanced so it includes \f(CW\*(C`vcenter\-https\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`xen\-ssh\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`in\-place\*(C'\fR facts (Pino Toscano).
.PP
\fILanguage bindings\fR
.IX Subsection "Language bindings"
.PP
Fix multiple memory leaks and other data corruption problems in the Java bindings (Pino Toscano).
.PP
Perl \f(CW%guestfs_introspection\fR has been dropped.
.PP
\fIInspection\fR
.IX Subsection "Inspection"
.PP
Inspection support was rewritten in OCaml and included inside the daemon. This makes inspection considerably faster, more robust and more easily extensible in future.
.PP
Better icon support for \s-1ALT\s0 Linux guests (Pino Toscano).
.PP
Better support for NeoKylin (Qingzheng Zhang).
.PP
Can handle OSes like Void Linux which do not include \f(CW\*(C`VERSION_ID\*(C'\fR in \fI/etc/os\-release\fR (Pino Toscano).
.PP
Add support for Microsoft MS-DOS (Daniel Berrangé).
.PP
\fIArchitectures and platforms\fR
.IX Subsection "Architectures and platforms"
.PP
Multiple fixes for S/390 architecture.  Libguestfs and all the tools should now compile and run on this architecture.
.PP
\fIOther\fR
.IX Subsection "Other"
.PP
The libguestfs \s-1API\s0 is now thread-safe (although not parallel).  You can call APIs on the same handle from multiple threads without needing to take a lock.
.SS "Security"
.IX Subsection "Security"
There were multiple vulnerabilities in the icoutils \f(CW\*(C`wrestool\*(C'\fR program which is run by libguestfs to create icons for Windows guests.  Using the latest \f(CW\*(C`wrestool\*(C'\fR is recommended.

.PP
\fIOther \s-1API\s0 changes\fR
.IX Subsection "Other API changes"
.PP
APIs implemented in the daemon can now be written in either C or OCaml. Several APIs were rewritten in OCaml, although we are not planning to rewrite all of them.
.PP
You will now get a clear error message if you try to add too many disks to the appliance, instead of getting a peculiar failure from qemu.
.PP
Certain APIs accidentally allowed you to use \f(CW\*(C`/dev/urandom\*(C'\fR as an input \*(L"device\*(R", eg. \f(CW\*(C`g.copy_device_to_device("/dev/urandom", "/dev/sda")\*(C'\fR.  The code has been modified to \fIforbid\fR this usage.
.PP
All APIs for inspecting installer CDs have been deprecated.  Use libosinfo for this task.
.SS "Build changes"
.IX Subsection "Build changes"
A working OCaml compiler ≥ 4.01 is now required for building libguestfs.  The \f(CW\*(C`./configure \-\-disable\-ocaml\*(C'\fR option remains but is only used to disable the OCaml language bindings.
.PP
Add \f(CW\*(C`RELEASES\*(C'\fR file which lists release dates for each version of libguestfs.  You must update this file when making a new release.
.PP
Documentation generated by \f(CW\*(C`gtk\-doc\*(C'\fR has been removed.  \f(CW\*(C`./configure \-\-enable\-gtk\-doc\*(C'\fR now does nothing.
.PP
Libtirpc is now used for \s-1XDR\s0 functions and rpcgen.  Note that glibc has deprecated and in most Linux distros dropped these, so for most people this will be an extra dependency (Martin Kletzander).
.PP
Libxcrypt is now used for \fBcrypt\fR\|(3).  This is required if using glibc ≥ 2.27.
.PP
\&\f(CW\*(C`ocaml\-hivex\*(C'\fR is now required.
.PP
Libvirt ≥ 1.2.20 is now required.
.PP
There is now a \f(CW\*(C`make check\-root\*(C'\fR target for tests which need to be run as root (analogous to \f(CW\*(C`make check\-slow\*(C'\fR).
.PP
\&\f(CW\*(C`./configure\*(C'\fR\-time check for \f(CW\*(C`_\|_attribute_\|_((cleanup))\*(C'\fR now works in the cross-compilation case (Yann E. Morin).
.PP
The \f(CW\*(C`AUTHORS\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`p2v/about\-authors.c\*(C'\fR files are now generated from a single place.
.PP
Either GnuPG v1 or v2 can be used.
.PP
\&\f(CW\*(C`./configure \-\-with\-guestfs\-path\*(C'\fR may be used to set the default \f(CW\*(C`LIBGUESTFS_PATH\*(C'\fR.  In addition the way that the path is searched has changed slightly so that all types of appliances are searched in each path element separately (Pavel Butsykin).
.PP
\&\f(CW\*(C`GUESTFSD_EXT_CMD\*(C'\fR which was used to mark external commands in the daemon has been removed.  It was originally used by \s-1SUSE\s0 builds, but they have not been using it for a while.
.PP
The output from \f(CW\*(C`./configure\*(C'\fR is now visually grouped under headings related to what it is doing, making it much easier to scan (Pino Toscano).
.PP
OCaml dependencies are now generated from a single script instead of multiple not-quite-the-same Makefile fragments.
.PP
\&\f(CW\*(C`./configure \-\-with\-distro=ID\*(C'\fR can be used to override automatic Linux distro detection at build time (Pino Toscano).
.PP
qemu ≥ 2.10 is supported (but not required).  This adds mandatory locking to disks and libguestfs turns this off in certain circumstances when it is known to be safe (Lars Seipel, Peter Krempa, Daniel Berrangé, Pino Toscano, Fam Zheng, Yongkui Guo, Václav Kadlčík).
.SS "内部"
.IX Subsection "内部"
Most common code has been moved to the \fIcommon/\fR subdirectory, with OCaml common code being in \fIcommon/ml*\fR directories (eg.  \fIcommon/visit\fR and \fIcommon/mlvisit\fR contain the visitor library in C and OCaml respectively). The \fImllib\fR directory has been deleted and replaced by \fIcommon/mltools\fR.
.PP
There is now a lightweight OCaml binding for \s-1PCRE,\s0 see \fIcommon/mlpcre\fR. Use of OCaml \f(CW\*(C`Str\*(C'\fR library has been mostly replaced with \s-1PCRE.\s0
.PP
Add more calls to \f(CW\*(C`udev_settle\*(C'\fR to improve stability of partition code (Dawid Zamirski).
.PP
Run \f(CW\*(C`udev_settle\*(C'\fR with \fI\-\-exit\-if\-exists\fR option, which improves the speed of this command (Pavel Butsykin).
.PP
Detect new locations of \fBmajor\fR\|(3), \fBminor\fR\|(3), \fBmakedev\fR\|(3).
.PP
Actions can now be deprecated with no suggested replacement, for APIs such as \f(CW\*(C`guestfs_wait_ready\*(C'\fR that should simply be removed from client code.
.PP
Use gnulib \f(CW\*(C`set_nonblocking_flag\*(C'\fR wrapper instead of calling \fBfcntl\fR\|(2) with \f(CW\*(C`O_NONBLOCK\*(C'\fR (Eric Blake).  Similarly \f(CW\*(C`set_cloexec_flag\*(C'\fR.
.PP
Fix memory leak in \s-1XFS\s0 version of \f(CW\*(C`guestfs_vfs_minimum_size\*(C'\fR (Pino Toscano).
.PP
Valgrind checks now run on the virt\-p2v binary.
.PP
Unicode single quotes (\f(CW\*(C`‘’\*(C'\fR) and now used in place of \f(CW\*(Aq\*(Aq\fR or \f(CW\`\*(Aq\fR throughout the code and documentation.  Similarly for \f(CW\*(C`’s\*(C'\fR instead of \f(CW\*(C`\*(Aqs\*(C'\fR.
.PP
The \f(CW\*(C`is_zero\*(C'\fR function has been reimplemented for greater speed (Eric Blake).
.PP
In the direct backend, virtio-blk support has been removed.  Virtio-scsi is now the only supported way to add disks.
.PP
Generator string parameter and return types have been rationalised so there are only two types (\f(CW\*(C`String\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`StringList\*(C'\fR) with many subtypes eg. \f(CW\*(C`FileIn\*(C'\fR becomes \f(CW\*(C`String (FileIn, ...)\*(C'\fR.
.PP
The appliance disk image can now be in formats other than raw (Pavel Butsykin).
.PP
Multiple improvements to how we automatically build Debian templates for virt-builder (Pino Toscano).  Enable serial console for these templates (Florian Klink).
.PP
In the daemon, instead of making a private copy of lvm.conf and modifying it (eg for filters), start with an empty file since \s-1LVM\s0 understands that to mean \*(L"all defaults\*(R" (Alasdair Kergon, Zdenek Kabelac).
.PP
The \f(CW\*(C`direct\*(C'\fR backend can now run \s-1QMP\s0 queries against the \s-1QEMU\s0 binary, enhancing the kinds of information we can detect.  In addition the code to query \s-1QEMU\s0 has been made more robust for handling multiple parallel queries of different versions of \s-1QEMU.\s0
.PP
OCaml Augeas bindings are bundled under \fIcommon/mlaugeas\fR.  The long term plan is to remove this and use system ocaml-augeas when it is more widely available in distros (Pino Toscano).
.PP
All OCaml modules (\f(CW\*(C`*.ml\*(C'\fR files) are now required to have an interface file (\f(CW\*(C`*.mli\*(C'\fR).  If they don't export anything then the interface will be empty except for comments.
.PP
Certain OCaml features in OCaml ≥ 4.01 are used throughout the code, including replacing ‘{ field = field }’ with ‘{ field }’.
.PP
Virt-builder \f(CW\*(C`make\-template\*(C'\fR utility now uses the \f(CW\*(C`virt\-install \-\-transient\*(C'\fR option so that we should never need to clean up left over domains after a crash.  It also saves kickstarts and virt-install commands, which are committed to git for future reference.
.PP
\&\fI/dev/shm\fR is now created in the appliance (Nicolas Hicher).
.PP
In verbose mode on Fedora guests, virt-customize will now use \f(CW\*(C`dnf \-\-verbose\*(C'\fR enabling better debugging output.
.PP
Virt\-v2v input and output classes now contain a \f(CW\*(C`#precheck\*(C'\fR method which is used to perform environmental checks before conversion starts.
.PP
Virt\-p2v enables miniexpect debugging.  It is written to stderr (of virt\-p2v).
.PP
Virt\-v2v free space checks are more liberal especially for smaller guests (Pino Toscano).
