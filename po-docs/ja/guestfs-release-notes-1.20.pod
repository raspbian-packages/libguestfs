guestfs-release-notes - libguestfs リリースノート

=head1 libguestfs 1.20 のリリースノート

These release notes only cover the differences from the previous stable/dev
branch split (1.18.0).  For detailed changelogs, please see the git
repository, or the ChangeLog file distributed in the tarball.

=head2 New features

=head3 libvirt and sVirt (SELinux confinement)

You can I<optionally> use libvirt to launch and manage the backend appliance
by:

=over 4

=item *

setting C<LIBGUESTFS_ATTACH_METHOD=libvirt[:URI]>

=item *

using C<./configure --with-default-attach-method=libvirt[:URI]>

=item *

or calling the API method C<guestfs_set_attach_method>

=back

SVirt (SELinux confinement) is used to secure the libguestfs appliance, if
the libvirt backend is selected.

=head3 virtio-scsi, larger number of drives, hotplugging

Virtio-scsi is now used by default, if it is available.  This greatly
increases the number of drives that can be added to a single libguestfs
handle (up to 255).

You can now hotplug drives (add and remove drives after launch).

Libguestfs can now handle E<gt> 25 disks, in all APIs, tools and tests.

You can label drives when adding them, then refer to them by label
(F</dev/disk/guestfs/LABEL>) instead of having to use device names
(F</dev/sda>).

=head3 new library features

POSIX Access Control Lists (ACLs) and Linux filesystem capabilities can now
be read and written through the API.

Windows Dynamic Disks are now supported.  The metadata can only be read
(volumes cannot be modified or created).  However the data/filesystems in
the volumes themselves can be mounted, read and written (Matthew Booth).

Hivex (Windows Registry editing) is now directly supported through the API,
making reading or editing the Windows Registry much more efficient.

Several libguestfs APIs were reimplemented so they no longer have any limits
on output.  The reimplemented APIs are: C<guestfs_cat>, C<guestfs_find>,
C<guestfs_read_file>, C<guestfs_read_lines>, C<guestfs_write>,
C<guestfs_write_append>, C<guestfs_lstatlist>, C<guestfs_lxattrlist>,
C<guestfs_readlinklist>, C<guestfs_ls>.

=head3 virt tools

C<guestfish touch 'win:c:\new_file'> now works as expected.

C<guestfish> has a new I<--network> option, which enables the user network
in libguestfs.

You can set C<GUESTFISH_PS1> to use fancy prompts in C<guestfish>.

C<rsync>, C<ssh>, C<less> and C<lrzip> commands are now available in
virt-rescue.  In addition, C<rsync> can be used through the API for doing
incremental copies.

C<virt-sparsify> uses qcow2 v3 for increased efficiency.

C<virt-sysprep> enhancements:

=over 4

=item *

generate new UUIDs for PVs and VGs

=item *

remove the local machine ID (Wanlong Gao)

=item *

remove ABRT data (Wanlong Gao)

=item *

remove puppet keys and log files (Wanlong Gao)

=item *

remove process accounting files (Wanlong Gao)

=item *

new I<--firstboot> parameter allowing firstboot scripts for customizing
guests

=item *

remove HOSTNAME field from C<ifcfg-eth*> files (Wanlong Gao)

=item *

miscellaneous improvements for SuSE (Olaf Hering)

=item *

remove man pages cache (Wanlong Gao)

=item *

remove crash data generated by kexec-tools (Wanlong Gao)

=back

C<virt-make-fs> can now create virtual floppy disks (VFDs).

C<guestmount> has a I<--pid-file> option, which can be used to avoid a race
condition between unmounting the filesystem and using the underlying disk
image.

=head3 language bindings

Full-featured Lua bindings have been added in this release (thanks to Jerome
Vuarand for many suggestions).

In Ruby, optional arguments hash is optional.

In Python, optional arguments now don't use special "sentinel" values, so
any integer can be passed as an optional argument.

Erlang bindings now come with examples and tests.

Erlang bindings now handle 64 bit integer parameters correctly.

The automated 'bindtests' now test for 64 bit cleanliness in parameter
passing.  Several bugs in the bindings were found and fixed as a result.

Better handling of blocking and non-blocking functions should make
libguestfs calls more efficient.

=head3 inspection

Windows guests with unlimited-sized Registries are now supported.  By adding
the hivex API to the libguestfs API, it is much more efficient and easier to
inspect and modify the Windows Registry in guests.

Better support for SuSE guests (Olaf Hering).

Return the architecture of installed applications (John Eckersberg).

Windows 8 is now supported.

Fedora 18 is now supported.

Inspection of ISOs/CDs/DVDs can now use the libosinfo database.

=head3 ports

Libguestfs without the appliance can be compiled on Mac OS X (Masami
HIRATA).

RHEL 5 is now explicitly supported through the 'oldlinux' branch in upstream
git.

PowerPC 64 bit is now supported.  Also libguestfs has been examined for
endianness bugs and these have been fixed.

=head3 daemon

A man page for the daemon (L<guestfsd(8)>) is included.

=head2 Security

=head3 guestfish history file

The F<$HOME/.guestfish> history file is now created with 0600 permissions
(instead of 0644 before) so it is no longer world readable.

=head3 CVE-2012-2690

Old versions of both C<virt-edit> and the C<guestfish> C<edit> command
created a new file containing the changes but did not set the permissions,
etc of the new file to match the old one.  The result of this was that if
you edited a security sensitive file such as F</etc/shadow> then it would be
left world-readable after the edit.

この問題は CVE-2012-2690 に割り当てられおり、libguestfs E<ge> 1.16 において修正されています。

In the C API only:

=head2 内部

qemu E<ge> 1.1 is required (E<ge> 1.2 preferred).

febootstrap E<ge> 3.20 is required.

libvirt is optional, but if you want to use the new libvirt backend for
launching the appliance then libvirt E<ge> 0.10.2 would be required.

Coverity has been run over the complete codebase, and many issues fixed
(thanks Ondrej Vasik, Kamil Dudka).

Functions which previously had no optargs can now be converted to ones with
optargs, making extending the API much more flexible.  Source and binary
backwards compatibility is preserved for users of the API.

The way that libguestfs APIs and structures are represented in the generator
has changed to use an OCaml struct instead of a tuple.  This makes generator
descriptions more flexible and easier to understand.  For details see
commits 39d1a7db and eb185eef.

Separation of the library code into more files:

=over 4

=item *

Launch backends are now located in separate files
eg. F<src/launch-appliance.c>, C<src/launch-libvirt.c>.

=item *

Generated action code is now split over several F<src/action*.c> files, for
faster compilation.

=item *

The huge F<src/guestfs.c> file is now split into smaller logical units.

=back

POD (documentation) is now generated using a rewritten Perl program instead
of pod2* + shell scripts.

Man pages now contain stable dates (Hilko Bengen).

Skipped tests now exit with code 77, so they appear as C<SKIP:> in C<make
check> output.

The parallel mount-local test has been rewritten in C (RHBZ#838081).

Ruby 1.8.5 is now supported (though Ruby E<ge> 1.9 is preferred).

Perl bindings can be disabled via C<./configure --disable-perl> (Wulf
C. Krueger).  Note that Perl is still required in order to build libguestfs.

Java bindings are now enabled/disabled using C<./configure --with-java> or
C<./configure --without-java> (Wulf C. Krueger).

New configure options C<./configure --enable-code-profiling> and
C<./configure --enable-code-coverage>.

Multiple fixes to use of 64 bit integers in language bindings.

The appliance backend now uses sgabios instead of vgabios (Dan Berrange).

The C<./run> script now sets enough environment variables that you can run
OCaml, Python, Ruby, Java, GJS, Erlang, Lua programs.

C<./run --test> flag for running tests with minimal output.  It also prints
the time taken to run each test.

The C<./run> script now builds up paths cumulatively, meaning that you can
use C<./run> twice, or use the libguestfs and libvirt C<./run> scripts
together.

You can extract a list of external commands required by the daemon, making
building the appliance on certain distros easier (Olaf Hering).

The C<virt-rescue> command is now tested during C<make check>.

The generator now removes unused generated files.  This helps when going
back and forth with git rebase, git bisect, etc.

Tests now run in a separate toplevel C<tmp/> directory in the source.  This
allows the directory to be labelled for SELinux (sVirt), and also makes it
easier to clean up.

C<make syntax-check> now works to a greater extent, and many problems in the
main code that were found by syntax-check have been fixed (thanks Jim
Meyering).

Emacs mode (-*- foo -*-) has been added to generated files.

Progress bar output is now sent to F</dev/tty> so it doesn't end up in the
regular output of the program.  virt-resize and virt-sparsify now suppress
progress bars if stdout is not a tty.

There is now a C<./configure --without-libvirt> option.  This is useful for
testing that the code still compiles without libvirt.

There is now an internal mini-library for running commands.  This allows us
to redirect errors from external commands into events.

Code for handling temporary directories and the appliance cache was
completely overhauled.

Code for temporarily ignoring/disabling errors now looks like this:

 guestfs_push_error_handler (g, NULL, NULL);
 guestfs_mkdir (g, "/foo"); /* We don't care if this fails. */
 guestfs_pop_error_handler (g);

The C<tests/extra> directory has gone.  The "extra tests" are now split into
separately runnable targets, such as C<make check-valgrind>.  Use C<make
help> to get a summary of the targets.

The C<lpj> option is passed to the appliance kernel when using TCG.  This
should improve clock stability (thanks Marcelo Tosatti, Olaf Hering).
