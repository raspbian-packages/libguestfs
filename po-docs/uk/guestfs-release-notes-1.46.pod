=head1 RELEASE NOTES FOR LIBGUESTFS 1.46

The big news in this release is that the virt tools like L<virt-builder(1)>,
L<virt-cat(1)>, L<virt-customize(1)>, L<virt-df(1)>, and many more were
moved to a new project.  The temporary repository for the new guestfs-tools
project is here: L<https://github.com/rwmjones/guestfs-tools> while we set
up a permanent home for it on gitlab.  The tarballs containing the tools are
here: L<https://download.libguestfs.org/guestfs-tools/>

Spinning out all of the tools into a new repository has made libguestfs a
bit easier and simpler to build and manage, and allows us to focus on just
being the API.

Note that the tools L<guestfish(1)> (which is really a "shell API"),
L<guestmount(1)>, L<libguestfs-test-tool(1)> and L<virt-rescue(1)> are still
part of the libguestfs repo.

The not quite so big news is that we have moved away from FreeNode to Libera
Chat for IRC.  The new channel on Libera is called C<#guestfs> (thanks
Daniel Berrangé).

=head2 Прив’язки до мов програмування

Libguestfs is now compatible with Go 1.16, and defines a Go module (thanks
Gianfranco Costamagna).

Memory leaks in Python APIs that returned structs are fixed (thanks 朱丹).

Python PyPi code has been relicensed to LGPLv2+ (from GPLv2+).

=head2 Перевірка

Inspection of RPM guests now uses librpm instead of trying to parse the
Berkeley DB directly.  Since most RPM-based guests have replaced BDB with
sqlite this allows us to read these newer guests while retaining
compatibility with the older guests (thanks Panu Matilainen).

Inspection of RHEL 8+ with split /usr configuration has been made more
reliable.

Inspection of Windows Server 2022 should now work correctly (Yongkui Guo).

=head2 API

=head3 Нові програмні інтерфейси

No new APIs were added in libguestfs 1.46.

=head3 Інші зміни у програмному інтерфейсі

The output of the C<guestfs_cap_get_file> API has changed slightly because
of changes in the underlying libcap.  This isn't strictly speaking an API
break because the new output is a still valid but more compact description
of file capabilities, but because it is different it may cause problems for
users of the API.

The C<guestfs_mkfs_btrfs> API now ignores the C<allocstart> parameter since
it was deprecated by btrfs 4.14.1 and later removed.

C<guestfs_isoinfo_*> APIs now directly parse the CD Primary Volume
Descriptor instead of using an external tool.  The APIs should appear to
work exactly the same (thanks Thomas Schmitt).

You can now force the appliance to use KVM or fail if not supported (Sam
Eiderman).

Because of a change to XFS in version 5, disabling lazy-counters no longer
works.  The API still works for earlier versions of XFS (Laszlo Ersek).

=head2 Зміни у збиранні

The build now uses and requires PCRE2 (instead of PCRE).

This version requires libvirt E<ge> 7.1.0, if libvirt is enabled.

gnulib is no longer bundled with libguestfs, making builds from git much
simpler.

Perl C<Sys::Virt> (libvirt bindings for Perl) are no longer required by
libguestfs.

The code has been compiled with both LTO and GCC I<-fanalyzer> and many bugs
and warnings fixed.

Allow projects like guestfs-tools and virt-v2v to be compiled with locally
built (but not installed) libguestfs (Laszlo Ersek).

Tests now run in parallel (many additional fixes by Laszlo Ersek).

Work around RAID0 regression in Linux 3.14/5.4 (Laszlo Ersek).

Support for RISC-V (Heinrich Schuchardt).

Support for building on Alma and Cloud Linux (Александр Кравченко).

Fix to compile with OCaml 4.12.

The tarball no longer includes the F<ChangeLog> file.  To get a detailed
changelog, please look at the upstream git repository.

Don't assume bash in the F<./configure> script (Martin Kletzander).

Fix F<./configure --with-distro> option (Alexandre Iooss).

Various fixes for qemu 6.1.

Fix creating appliance dependencies on Debian (Hilko Bengen).

Update appliance packages on SUSE and several other improvements to the init
script (Olaf Hering).

=head2 Внутрішня частина роботи програми

We now use the qemu / libvirt feature I<-cpu max> to select the best CPU to
run the appliance.  This should improve performance for things like
encrypted disks (Daniel Berrangé).

When passing the appliance filesystem UUID to supermin we now read it
directly out of the appliance instead of using the L<file(1)> program.  This
is more reliable, especially as file often breaks or changed its output.

The qemu I<-enable-fips> option is no longer used.  It was not needed and
has been deprecated by qemu.

On Fedora, pull in glibc-gconv-extra to fix the C<guestfs_syslinux> API
(Yongkui Guo).

We no longer use qemu's sga (Serial Graphics Adapter) option ROM, instead
using the equivalent seabios feature.
